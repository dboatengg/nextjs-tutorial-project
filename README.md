# Next.js Intro Before Movie App

This project contains all the code built so far in the “Getting Started with Next.js” tutorial, covering the fundamentals of the App Router before moving into the full movie application.

## What’s Included

This repository demonstrates the core Next.js concepts:

- Project setup with create-next-app
- App Router basics
- Pages and routes (page.tsx)
- Layouts (`layout.tsx`)
- Navigation using the `<Link>` component
- Data fetching in Server Components
- Updating data with `revalidate` and `no-store`
- Loading and error handling (`loading.tsx` / `error.tsx`)
- Styling with Tailwind CSS

At this stage, the project includes:

- A homepage
- An About page
- A Posts page (using a placeholder API)
- A shared layout with navigation
- Tailwind-based styling

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
